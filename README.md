Welcome to my real-time chat app, developed using React and Socket.IO! This app provides users with a platform to communicate with each other instantly, with features such as chat rooms, private messaging, and real-time notifications. The front-end of the app is built using React, allowing for a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the back-end is powered by Socket.IO to enable real-time communication between users. This app uses web sockets to maintain a persistent connection between users and the server, ensuring a seamless chat experience. Users can create and join chat rooms, send private messages to other users, and receive notifications when they receive new messages. Our app is easy to install and deploy, with instructions included in the README file. We are excited to share this chat app with you and welcome any feedback or contributions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
